## 🧐 What’s This All About?

This project is **not** a tutorial repo.  
It’s my personal corner of the internet—built with Flask and a pinch of vanilla CSS—to show the world (and future employers 👀) what I can do.

Think of it as:

- **Project showroom** —  _Latest code experiments, side‑quests, and half‑baked ideas._
- **Blog outlet** —  _Occasional rants about tech, life, and why tabs beat spaces._

## ⚙️ Under the Hood (Brief)

- **Flask** handles the routing magic.  
- **HTML5 + CSS custom properties** give it that sleek, theme‑able vibe.  
- **Google Fonts – Montserrat** for that clean typographic drip.  
- Zero JS frameworks—because sometimes less _is_ more.
